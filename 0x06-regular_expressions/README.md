#Regular Expressions

I learned how to use regular expressions.

Tasks:
0. Simply matching Holberton

0-simply_match_holberton.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression School.
1. Repetition Token #0

1-repetition_token_0.rb: Ruby script that matches the regular expression hbn with between 2-5 t's in between hb and n.
